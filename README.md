# Application to The Radiation Monitoring Data 
The study of Radiation Monitoring Data can help to develop systematic data on environmental radiation/radioactivity distribution as a criterion for assessing public health. And in the event of a radiation safety emergency, the analysis of the data is important for maintaining national security and the environment. Radiation monitoring allows us to understand how much and what kind of radioactive material is present in the area and to test the mathematical model used to estimate the dose of human radiation.
The project aims to find the correlation between different locations and monitoring time through the radiation monitoring historical data from 2014 to 2017. Besides, the air quality observation data are also analyzed to find the correlation with radiation.
